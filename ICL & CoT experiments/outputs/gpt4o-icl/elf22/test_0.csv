Tips on arm hypertrophy?,"I’m 21M 5’7” 145lbs and I have skinny arms. Originally I focused on strength, but I’m trying to get some hypertrophy and it doesn’t seem to be working.        I can do 3x5 50lbs weighted pull-ups and dips, but I still feel like I have stick arms. My chest and back have definitely improved, but not arms.        What are some good exercises and tips for arm hypertrophy? Thanks!","The simplest was to get bigger arms fast is high-rep, relatively low weight work.   Try doing sets of 50 bicep curls, with a light weight- so that you arms should be burning like hell at the end of the 50. And do a good number of those sets (like 8). These are also very good for developing forearms.  Triceps add a lot to the size of the arms. The most effective, high rep exercise for triceps is sphinx push ups. Try doing 6 sets of 50 of those.",troll,"Tips on arm hypertrophy? I’m 21M 5’7” 145lbs and I have skinny arms.

There is no way for Tyrod to be 100% this week because if he gets hit in the chest there is risk for a recurrence of the pneumothorax which I guess is the complication that Tyrod had from the Toradol shot.

Stop with the QB controversy crap,49er fans that are saying that Mullens is better than Jimmy are like the ones that wanted Bono over Young or Rattay over Garcia.  Jimmy looked good even though he was hobbled. Nick didn’t look that good.,"It's not about Mullens being as good as Jimmy.  It's about Jimmy costing 27 million a year and Mullens costing pennies.
