Circumsion is literally male genitalia mutilation. You are literally lopping off a part of a mans penis when you circumsize him. Now it may not have any major effect on their life. But its true. Its normalizing genitalia mutilation. Which also harms women because it being normalized means people start thinking its okay to do to women. Which its not. Because it can have a major effect on a womans life. Up to and including them not being able to have pleasure during sex.   So yes i do think circumsion (aka male genitalia mutilation) does have a negative impact on women.   I also think that circumsion its self needs to be reevaluated.

This sub is an echo chamber of people fighting against a nonexistent subgroup of “femnazis”. No one is trying to put men in a cave so women can be supreme. The boogeyman isn’t real.   The people here lash out at feminism by rebranding feminism into something entirely different and then hating it. It’s an absurd false flag to help some people through some deep insecurities. It’s as ridiculous as telling someone you hate apples and you point out “look at those apples they are disgusting”, and then pointing to a table full of pumpkins.  You hate something, but it’s not feminism and you keep calling it feminism. [SEP] Sure and then there are tweets about feminists makeing fun of an man getting raped at gun point."

When men are judged by women, the fault is on men for not appreciating being judged  When women have close relationships with women, it's empowering and they're apart of the ""sisterhood"". When men have close relationships with men, it's ""fragile masculinity"" and they should be shamed for not prioritizing women above everyone else  So as usual, everything women do is good and everything men do is bad. It's bitter cunts like this author, not ""fragile masculinity"", why a lot of guys prefer their guy friends than spending time with certain kinds of women [SEP] Toxic masculinity, fragile masculinity.  I think these women just hate men"

","No, it's not...It has absolutely nothing to with people who don't want to have children you selfish prick.   The point of maternity and paternity leave is the health of the newborn. Contact with the mother and father is important to the health of the baby. Also, dishing off your baby to a baby farm is frankly dangerous.   Recovery for the mother is also important. I don't think you're going to be back to work the next day if you just shit out a bowling ball.   Paternity, in the grand scheme of things, is important if you're into the nuclear family concept, but I believe there are studies that support having the father around a newborn is also important to the development of said kid.

People are being gradually conditioned to accept discrimination and devaluation of white men as normal or good. People should be punished for how they were born and/or things that happened before they were born.",You're comparing apples and oranges. Look at the data specific to the field.,"Quick addition to my comment- you should spread this on social media, show your male classmates what is happening to them. This goes on allowed because people aren't aware of it.  It makes no sense to disfavor men from educational and employment opportunities, boys are less likely to attend university at all levels, and men have a higher unemployment rate. Boys earn lower grades and are given [lower grades for the same work](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/02/16/female-teachers-give-male_n_1281236.html).   Why should a boy from a working class family be disfavored over a girl from a wealthy family for a financial aid scholarship? The gender that is less likely to attend university due to structural disadvantage shouldn't be facing discrimination in education.
